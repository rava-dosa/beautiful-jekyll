My name is Apoorva Kumar. I am pursuing a Btech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Kharagpur, Some principles and Qualities:

- I never forget my friends, ever.
- I am blessed and flawed in magnificent ways, and they cater to each other.
- I am just goddamn creative &#128521;

### Why I started blogging ?
One of the major reason is, I spend a lot of time reading and experimenting, But not all turn to some fruitful project. But is that wasted ? No whatever I read nothing is wasted. So for every third person who thinks who might misjudge my caliber and knowledge, this blog is for those people.
### My history
This blog and my CV will tell a lot about my technological prowess.
