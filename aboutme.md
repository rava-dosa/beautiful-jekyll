My name is Apoorva Kumar. I am pursuing Btech in Computer Science and Engineering from Indian Institute of Kharagpur. I am in my final year. And I am looking for opportunities.
  
### Why I started blogging ?
One of the major reason is, I spend a lot of time reading and experimenting, But not all turn to some fruitful project. But is that wasted ? No whatever I read nothing is wasted. So for every third person who might misjudge my caliber or knowledge, this blog is for those people. Clarifying to every person, that I am different is really painful for me. And in the world of social media where everyone is bogged down by information and story every story and information seems fake. 
### My history
This blog and my CV will tell a lot about my technological prowess.
