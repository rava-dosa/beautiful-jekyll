### According to wikipedia
Profile-guided optimization (PGO, sometimes pronounced as pogo), also known as profile-directed feedback (PDF) and feedback-directed optimization (FDO) is a compiler optimization technique in computer programming that uses profiling to improve program runtime performance. 
### What it really means
**again from wikipedia:-**
Optimization techniques based on analysis of the source code.
### How to do it ?
**Read it** [AutoFDO tutorial](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/AutoFDO/Tutorial)
### PostScript
**For ML/DL Fanatics** [But Not Compiler Stuff](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45290)  
**Some things I just know**
- I know it was really brief, but it was written in a very less time. Because someone told me, "You started really late if you are not disappointed from your first blog. **LOL**"
- Next time you visit this might be more detailed along with code snippets and internals.
